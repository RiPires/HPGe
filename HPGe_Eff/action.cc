    // Id: G4VUserActionInitialization.hh 
    // class description:
    //
    //  This is the abstract base class for instantiating all the user action classes.
    // It has a pure virtual method Build() which is invoked by G4RunManager for
    // sequential execution and G4WorkerRunManager for multi-threaded execution.
    // The additional virtual method BuildForMaster() will be invoked from G4MTRunManager
    // for multi-threaded execution.
    //
    //  Note that these virtual methods are const. It means the user may construct
    // user action objects, but should not store the pointers of these objects as
    // data members of the derived class.
    //
    // Note for multi-threaded mode:
    //  The only action class the user may set to G4MTRunManager is a run action. It is
    // then used at the beginning and the end of a run. It may be the same class or a
    // dedicated class different from the run action instantiated for G4WorkerRunManager.
